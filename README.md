# Main idea
The idea of the game is that the mouse "runs" across the screen from the starting point to the end point. After reaching the end point, the mouse randomly runs in any other arbitrary direction again. And so it repeats endlessly until exiting the game. For example, you can exit the game cycle by pressing the hardware "Back" button.
# The application has:
1. Splash screen displayed during app download
2. The home screen where you can select the size, speed and number of "mice". It is enough to make from 1 to 5 "mice".
3. There should be a "Start" button or menu at the bottom of the home screen, or another understandable way to start the game, by clicking which you will be redirected to the game screen.
3. A record should be kept of the number of clicks on the screen during the game and how many times the player managed to click on the mouse image. Statistics must be saved to a database table.
5. To display click statistics, there must be a button or the "Score" menu on the home screen, or another way to access the game results screen.
6. The last 10 games should be displayed on the game results screen. For each game, the total number of taps on the screen and the number of times the mouse was hit, as well as the percentage of hits from the total number of taps and the game time.
